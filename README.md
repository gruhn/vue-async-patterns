# vue-async-patterns

Demo of several patterns to deal with asynchonous processes and events in Vue.js. Created for [Aachen Vue.js Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/aachen-vue-js-meetup/events/254565078/).

To run this locally you need [npm]() and an ES6 capable browser (code is not transpiled). If you have that clone this repository and navigate into the root directory via terminal. Then run the following commands: 

```bash
npm install
npm start
```
You should now be able to access the demo at http://localhost:8080

To switch between different demos [modify this line](https://github.com/gruhn/vue-async-patterns/blob/ff5f7d7cf720f96d1711c8e1786c00231ff0d2b0/index.html#L21).
